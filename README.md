👋 Hi, I’m @rowanjacobscode

👀 I’m interested in exploring the rapidly evolving world of technology. With a background in Business Control and a passion for digital innovation, I'm embarking on an exciting journey to become a developer.

🌱 I’m currently learning the fundamentals of programming, focusing on web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and exploring frameworks like React.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that allow me to grow my coding skills, particularly those that combine my interest in digital marketing and technology.

📫 How to reach me: You can contact me via LinkedIn.

⚡ Fun fact: Alongside my career in IT and marketing, I've developed websites and apps as hobby projects. Recently, I undertook a 2.5-month solo journey across the United States, which further ignited my passion for tech and international cultures.
